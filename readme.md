# Lua Linear Algebra Library

A library that contains the necessities for 3D game development. Make sure you have a good understanding of Linear Algebra. I surely do not.

## Notes:
* All modules are associated with their return types (vec.lua usually returns vector objects)
* Your vectors can be any length
* mat.lua assumes square matrices while dimensions are "n by n"
